# _AUTOSCALE_PROJECT
This project focuses on setting up an auto-scaling infrastructure for Nginx on AWS EC2, using modern DevOps tools for automation, monitoring, and orchestration. The goal is to ensure high availability, scalability, and efficient deployment of web servers.
Through the use of automation tools like Terraform, Jenkins/GitLab CI, and Ansible, the deployment process is streamlined and efficient. The integration of auto-scaling, load balancing, and real-time monitoring ensures optimal performance, cost efficiency, and reliability. By addressing key challenges in scalability and availability, this infrastructure solution provides a robust framework capable of handling varying traffic loads while maintaining system health and security.
